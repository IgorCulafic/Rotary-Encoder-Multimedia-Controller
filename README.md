# Rotary-Encoder-Multimedia-Controller

An Arduino project for multimedia controller with 4x4 options. 

IMPORTANT!

Not all cases have been filled and most of them are fillers for testing.
To add more use the  HID-Project library documentation: https://github.com/NicoHood/HID/wiki/Consumer-API which is provided in the code as well

Add more switch cases if you want more options.
If you want more profiles (5x5, 6x6, etc.) All you need to do is increas the max count (int maxModes and int maxBTNModes) and add the new cases and LED's

Pictures and circuit layout will be provided at a later date.
